                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I graduated from St. John's University in Minnesota in 2018, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in 
                    Math. In the Fall of 2018 I began my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Oregon advised by <a href="https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~dou/">Dr. Dejing Dou</a>
                    and <a href="https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~lowd/">Dr. Daniel Lowd</a>. I am currently researching techniques to make deep neural networks more interpretable.
                    My hope is to leverage the knowledge I gain to help build provably safe and beneficial machine learning systems. </p>
                <p> In my free time I love to read and play basketball, guitar, and poker. </p>
