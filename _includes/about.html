                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I graduated from St. John's University in Minnesota in 2018, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in 
                    Math. In the Fall of 2018 I began my PhD at the University of Oregon working with Dr. Dejing Dou on 
                    explainable deep learning systems. My hope is to leverage the knowledge I gain to help build provably 
                    safe and beneficial AI. </p>
                <p> In my free time I love to read and play basketball, guitar, and poker. </p>
