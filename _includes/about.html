                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I graduated from St. John's University in Minnesota in 2018 with a major in computer science and a minor in 
                    mathematics. In the fall of 2018, I began my Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Oregon, advised by 
                    <a href="https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~dou/" target="_blank">Dr. Dejing Dou</a>
                    and <a href="https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~lowd/" target="_blank">Dr. Daniel Lowd</a>. 
                    I am now in the third year of the Ph.D. program, and I am researching techniques to make deep neural networks 
                    more interpretable while helping to TA CIS 210. My hope is to leverage the knowledge I gain to help build provably safe and beneficial 
                    deep learning systems. </p>
                <p> In my free time I love to read and play basketball, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgx_qqXTw_69a-zlO940aPA/videos" target="_blank">guitar</a>, and chess. </p>
